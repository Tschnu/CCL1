## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** The theme and style came together seamlessly, and the sprites were fun to design.
- **Core Mechanics:** The gravity-based gameplay worked better than expected and provided a unique challenge.

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** Implementing all the features we envisioned wasn’t possible due to the limited timeframe.
- **Bug Fixes:** Handling collisions and edge cases for gravity mechanics was tricky.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Prototyping Matters:** Testing early prototypes helped refine the core mechanics quickly.
- **Keep it Simple:** Focusing on one unique mechanic instead of multiple features made the game more polished.
