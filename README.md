## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Mug:** I really like the design of the mug, although it is very simple.
- **Core Mechanics:**

### Challenges:
- **Pixelated:** In the end it only was one line of code I hade to add to make the objects pixelated and not smoothed out, but it took me longer to realize that, than I thought.
- **Falling through:** The mug kept falling though one place in the game. In the end the solution was the order of the platforms, that the mug is standing on.
- **Music:** One soundeffect wouldn't work and it took me a long time to fix it.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Diffrent Style:** I drew the mug first and than the rest. Only later on I realized, that the Mug has a black outline but nothing else. Also you can see a little bit of the top of the mug but no other object can be seen from that angle.
